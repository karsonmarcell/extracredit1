    <h1>Karson Marcellino</h1>
    <p>I am in my 5th year studying Computer Science at Towson University and set to graduate in spring 2024. 
        I also enjoy math so I am minoring in Mathematics which is why I am most interested in Computer Graphics. Outside of coding and all things computer science,
        I like to read, paint, cook, and learn new things
